The study section shows flashcards initially showing the Chinese characters and pronounciation. Clicking on a card will flip the card and display the English translation.

Clicking on "new game" in the game section will create a new set of shuffled cards. Cards are compared using their ids and will fade into the background if correct. Wrong answers will flash red and remain on the board.
